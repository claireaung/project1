# Hi Dmitrii,

## I didn't use the dataset that is provided in the description. I use my own dataset that is found on kaggle. But the comments you are giving is for the dataset that is provided in the description. I am a little bit confused. But I structured the my EDA notebook as you requested. Please let me know if there is anything to fix. Thank you so much for your review on my project.
